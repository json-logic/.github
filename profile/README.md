# JSON Logic Community ü§ù‚ú®

Welcome to the *JSON Logic Community*! Our mission is to foster collaboration among maintainers and users of JSON Logic implementations across platforms to develop a more *rigorous specification*, promote compatibility, and provide resources that make JSON Logic more robust and beneficial to everyone.


## Why This Organization Exists üåç

Many productivity applications require a way to serialize and define filters and sandbox application capabilities, and [many folks end up rolling their own implementations](https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1796338513165611080). 

JSON Logic has become a reasonably well-used standard for expressing conditional logic in a portable & embeddable format. 

With time, inconsistencies and ambiguities have emerged between different implementations, making it challenging for developers to rely on JSON Logic across platforms. 

Developing a standard specification and robust test suite will ideally make JSON Logic easier to adopt; and empower developers further.

## Our Goals üöÄ

1. **Develop a Rigorous Specification**
- Address ambiguities and inconsistencies in the current spec.
- Define behaviors for edge cases (e.g., truthiness, accessing empty keys and keys with separators in them).

2. **Build Compatibility Resources**
- Create and maintain a compatibility table for implementations.
- Provide a robust test suite for maintainers to validate their projects.

3. **Support JSON Logic Maintainers**
- Offer resources and community support to help resolve implementation differences.
- Facilitate collaboration between maintainers to align on common goals.

4. **Encourage Extensibility**
- Identify and spec out common extensions.
- Release shared libraries or guidelines for extending JSON Logic.

## Key Challenges We Aim to Address üß©

Here are some examples of challenges we‚Äôre working on:

- Accessing keys like `{ '': 1 }` or `{ 'hello.world': 1 }`.
- Truthiness quirks, such as `{ "!": [0] }` vs `{ "!": 0 }`; and `{ "!": { "var": "data" } }`, where `data` is an array.
- Handling iterator contexts (e.g., accessing parent context in filter operations).
- Defining behaviors for .length and similar properties in var operations. (a `length` operator is likely preferable)
- Aligning on reserved operators and backwards-compatible extensions.
- How to embed data in logic, and what is interpreted as data vs logic.
- There also just tend to be quirks between different implementations (auto-flattening of arrays, single-argument parameters)

## How You Can Help ‚ù§Ô∏è

We believe in the power of open collaboration! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Join the Conversation**
- Participate in discussions to shape the specification and resolve ambiguities.

2. **Submit Feedback**
- Share issues, quirks, or use cases you've encountered with JSON Logic.

3. **Contribute to Resources**
- Help build the compatibility table or improve the test suite.

4. **Later on, participate in extension discussions**

## Get Involved! üéâ

Whether you‚Äôre a project maintainer, developer, or JSON Logic enthusiast, we‚Äôd love to have you onboard!

We'd also love to have volunteers willing to adopt abandoned implementations.
