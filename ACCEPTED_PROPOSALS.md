Respecting Backwards Compatibility | - Defines the main output of this initiative as "JSON Logic Core" <br/><br/> - Establishes `tests.json` as our baseline compatibility suite for JSON Logic Core. <br/><br/> - Introduces the concept of the "Legacy" Extension. <br/><br/> - Defines a process for deprecating operators as we define JSON Logic Core, without breaking backwards compatibility. | https://github.com/orgs/json-logic/discussions/16 | [base.json](https://github.com/json-logic/.github/blob/main/tests/base.json)
Define JSON Logic on the JSON Data Model | - Defines JSON Logic on the data model of JSON Logic, (strings, numbers, true / false, null, arrays, objects) <br/><br/> - JSON Logic may be embedded in other formats, given it provides the same constructs (e.g. YAML) <br/> <br/> - JSON Logic is not defined strictly on the lexical parsing of JSON, but on the data model constructs (whitespace, number formatting, etc is out of scope) <br/><br/> - Core will be precision agnostic with respect to numbers. Operators will be defined from a pure math definition. <br/><br/> - The JSON Logic Organization can mandate a "Recommended Baseline" for implementations, that can be updated as Community Extensions become more common. This is not attached to the RFC. <br/><br/> - This mandated baseline could specify necessary supported precision(s). <br/><br/> - Profiles / Baselines maintained by the JSON Logic Organization will be shown in our compatibility tables.  | https://github.com/orgs/json-logic/discussions/17 | N/A
