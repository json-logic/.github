# Code of Conduct

We follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

<!-- 
  We may want to appoint someone else to handle Code of Conduct reports; for now I'll take them. 
-->
Please contact [Jesse](mailto:jesse.daniel.mitchell@gmail.com) or the [CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](mailto:conduct@cncf.io)
in order to report violations of the Code of Conduct.
